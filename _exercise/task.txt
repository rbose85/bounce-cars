Exercise
--------

There is no right/wrong answer to this problem, and your level of experience will be taken into account when assessing your solutions.

The Exercise:
-------------
Provide a simple REST web API written in Python to retrieve data from the provided data set. 

The users of this API need to be able to specify a range of timestamps and optionally name which columns they are interested in. The API should return the relevant data in a JSON format.

Please spend 1 hour in this exercise. Use of third-party libraries and tools is fine. If you do use third-party libraries provide a more polished solution (e.g. a more flexible API).

Please send your solution back to us in a zip file after working on it for 1 hour - it doesnâ€™t need to be complete.
